    <h1>The Balearic Biodiversity Centre</h1>

      The Balearic Biodiversity Centre (<b>CBB</b>) is a scientific initiative that aims to generate knowledge 
      about the biological diversity and the natural environment of the Balearic archipelago. 
      Such information is crucial to establish management and conservation policies and to 
      maintain the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides to society. 
      The Balearic Biodiversity Centre is composed of a team of specialized researchers 
      and technicians that can offer scientific-technical support for research groups, 
      government managers, and the private sector, as well as to promote strategic collaborations, 
      advice, and training on issues related to biodiversity.
